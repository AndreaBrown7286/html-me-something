    <h2>Why I go camping.</h2>
        <p>I consider camping to be one of the best activites a family can take part in.
            Some of my earliest and fondest memories are of being at a campgrouds, playing 
            at the playground or the lake with new friends, sitting around a campfire roasting
            marshmellows with family before going to bed in my grandparents camper. I am happy to
            say I fell in love with camping as a child and I am proud to carry on a tradition by
            teaching my children the same love.
