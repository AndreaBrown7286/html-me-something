            <h2>Why I go camping.</h2>
                <p>I consider camping to be one of the best activites a family can take part in.
                    Some of my earliest and fondest memories are of being at a campgrouds, playing 
                    at the playground or the lake with new friends, sitting around a campfire roasting
                    marshmellows with family before going to bed in my grandparents camper. I am happy to
                    say I fell in love with camping as a child and I am proud to carry on a tradition by
                    teaching my children the same love.
